<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>about 12 dry dried ladyfinger cookies (savoiardi biscuits)</li>
<li>1 cup cold heavy cream</li>
<li>1/3 cup powdered sugar</li>
<li>1 cup mascarpone cheese, at room temperature)</li>
<li>1 cup strong coffee, cold</li>
<li>6 tsp Kahlua or other spirit of your choice</li>
<li>1-2 ounces dark chocolate for grating</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>You’ll need 4 glasses for serving, I used classic lowball glasses.</p>
<ol>
<li>Whip the cream with the sugar until it forms soft peaks, then gently fold in the room temperature mascarpone until they are both combined. Don’t beat, just fold gently.</li>
<li>Mix the cold coffee and Kahlua together in a shallow bowl.</li>
<li>Working one ladyfinger at a time, cut each biscuit into one inch pieces, and dip them into the coffee to saturate. Put the pieces at the bottom of one glass. Repeat with all the glasses.</li>
<li>Top each layer of soaked biscuits with a spoonful of the mascarpone/cream mixture. Top with a second layer of dipped cookies. Top with more cream, then a last layer of soaked cookies and a final topping of cream. Finish off with a generous amount of shaved chocolate. Note: if you love chocolate, feel free to add chocolate shavings to each layer.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Cook’s notes</h2>
Make sure your mascarpone cheese is truly soft and at room temperature, I leave it out the night before.
Don’t over beat your cream and mascarpone together, just gently fold.
Make your tiramisu at least a few hours ahead of serving to allow the flavors to mingle and the mouse-like texture to develop
To make tiramisu without alcohol, just leave it out, the coffee will give it plenty of flavor.
You can actually make your own ladyfingers, which I’m planning to try one day, it looks like fun!
This dessert is quite rich, and you could actually use smaller glasses and make 8 servings.
